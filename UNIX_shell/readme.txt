I present to you my very own UNIX shell - 'shush'.

This project corresponds to P1Ch3.

This project consists of designing a C program to serve as a shell interface
that accepts user commands and then executes each command in a separate
process. The implementation should support input and output redirection, as
well as pipes as a form of IPC between a pair of commands.
